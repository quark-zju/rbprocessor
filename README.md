RbProcessor is a CodeProcessor plug-in that use external Ruby script to preprocess and postprocess code.

Install
=======
1. Download `rbprocessor.jar` from download page
2. Append `rbprocessor.jar` to CodeProcessor class path
3. Prepare a `$HOME/.config/rbprocessor.rb` or `$HOME/.rbprocessor.rb`.
4. Configure CodeProcessor:

    *  Use 'popsedit.EntryPoint' or 'fileedit.EntryPoint' as the Editor
       (If you use Standard Editor, code highlighting may not working.
        You can do fileedit things in ruby script, see following).
    *  Use 'rbprocessor.RbProcessor' as the CodeProcessor.
 

rbprocessor.rb
==============
`rbprocessor.rb` must have two methods:

    def preprocess(src, lang, prob, render)
        # $src, $lang, $prob, $render are available too

        # Makes $HELLO$ tag available
        user_tags     = { hello: 'world' }

        # If you want to use FileEdit's code template,
        # set processed_src to ''
        processed_src = "main() {\n\n}"

        [processed_src, user_tags]
    end

    def postprocess(src, lang)
        processed_src = src.gsub(/^\s+$/, '')

        # postprocess only process code, no user tags
        processed_src
    end

`rbprocessor.rb` is reloaded on the fly if change detected.
